# Voucher Application

## üìù Overview

This is a NodeJS (ExpressJS) practice project focused on:

- Handling **MongoDB transactions** safely and efficiently.
- Issuing **vouchers** under a limited quota per event.
- Managing **edit locks** to prevent concurrent editing on events.
- Using **Bull queue** for background email processing.

This project helps reinforce concepts like database transaction integrity, retry logic, and distributed locking mechanisms.
